# CRED

We have Cloned a credit card bill payment platform called cred.
CRED is an Indian fintech startup, based out of Bangalore, Karnataka, which was founded in 2018 by Kunal Shah. CRED's main feature is allowing users to make credit card payments through its app for which they get rewarded.

In this project , we have tried to make a perfect clone of cred.club.

# Steps to install the project:

## Install basic Software:
* Install NodeJS
* Install VS Code
* Install Git

## Clone the following git repository inside any folder:

* https://github.com/avinashnadkar/cred.git

##  Open the cloned git repo in VS Code and install the required dependencies.

* #### Open a terminal and make sure you are in the working directory folder (Inside Cred folder go to : Cred/server for backend), run this command to install the required project dependencies in both back-end and front-end folder.
  * npm install   

* #### Now, Run npm start in sever as well as Cred folder in two separate terminals to start the backend and frontend

* #### Now you can access the app at this URL: http://localhost:3000
